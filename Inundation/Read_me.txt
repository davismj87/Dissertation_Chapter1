#Inundation Duration

*Data collection*: To quantify inundation duration based on surface elevation, we used barometrically-compensated water level
data collected from a Solinst LTC level logger installed in historic marsh. Data were logged continuously at 15 minute intervals 
between February 2010 and January 2015. We converted water level (m) to elevation (m NAVD88) using Real-Time Kinematic Global 
Positioning System (RTK GPS) validated sensor height. We also used the dataset to derive a local tidal datum for the Nisqually 
River Delta (MHHW = 3.1 m, MHW = 2.8 m, MTL = 1.4 m, MLW = -0.1 m, MLLW = -1 m). Because the sensor was positioned above MLW 
(0.35 m), low tide values were derived using the mean proportional distance between MTL and MLW, and MTL and MLLW for ten other 
nearby sites with active NOAA tide gauges.
